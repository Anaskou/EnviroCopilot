# EnviroCopilot
EnviroCopilot is an offline AI health assistant that uses EU satellites data to protect people from heat, pollution, UV, and wildfire smoke. It generates a personalized 0–100 risk score, sends clear alerts, and lets you check on loved ones — like an elderly parent — so your whole family can stay safe, even during blackouts.
