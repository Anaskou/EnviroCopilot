# EnviroCopilot
EnviroCopilot is an offline AI health assistant that uses real-time Copernicus satellite data to protect users from heat, air pollution, UV radiation, and wildfire smoke. It generates a personalized 0â€“100 environmental health risk score, delivers plain-language alerts, runs fully on-device (with no cloud), and enables care-sharing with family members â€” turning complex satellite data into actionable, life-saving insights.
